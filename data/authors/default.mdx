I’m a software developer transitioning into the world of embedded and systems engineering, with a growing focus on RISC-V and open source software. 
My background spans frontend, backend, cloud, and automation, and now I’m channeling that experience into low-level programming with C and Rust. 
Through self-study, open source contributions, and hands-on IoT projects, I’m building the skills to contribute to impactful OSS communities.
