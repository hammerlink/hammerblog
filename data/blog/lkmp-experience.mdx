### Starting my Kernel Mentorship journey

This year I began a transition into embedded programming, driven by my interest in meaningful open-source projects and a strong desire to contribute to them. 
When I came across the Linux Kernel Mentorship Program, it felt like the perfect match for my situation, and I was thrilled to be accepted.

I quickly learned it’s not about being taught step by step. 
You grow by exploring, reading, experimenting, and putting in the effort yourself. 
But you’re never alone: mentors, ex-mentees, and fellow participants are always there to share knowledge and answer questions.
That mix of independence and community support makes the mentorship a truly rewarding experience.

### Submitting My First Patches

My first contributions weren’t groundbreaking features.
They were small fixes: a spelling correction and a refactor replacing scnprintf with sysfs_emit.
Working on them helped me understand the kernel patch workflow in practice, applying the lessons from LFD103: A Beginner’s Guide to Linux Kernel Development.

Getting the patch flow right is not trivial. 
Reading the documentation is essential, but so is subscribing to mailing lists and observing how patch discussions unfold. 
Sending out that first patch can be intimidating, I probably triple-checked mine before hitting send. 
After all, you’re putting your work out into the open, not knowing how many people might review it.

Thanks to the beginner’s guide, I avoided most common pitfalls. After applying some fixes, both patches were accepted, a very satisfying milestone.
It was kind of cool that they were picked up directly by Jonathan Corbet and Greg Kroah-Hartman, two of the co-authors of Linux Device Drivers, Third Edition, which I happened to be reading at the time.
Having those first patches accepted gave me the confidence to move beyond small fixes and start exploring deeper areas of the kernel.

### Exploring RISC-V Hardware

I began working with a RISC-V development board around the time it was first released. 
I had already come across it before and thought it would be a good candidate for experimenting with the kernel. 
From reading other mentees’ blogs, I knew how valuable it is to have real hardware on hand when exploring and contributing.

When I started working with the board, I discovered that its SoC wasn’t yet supported in the mainline kernel. 
It did run with a downstream Linux version, but that suggested it would eventually need to be upstreamed.
This task felt a bit too large to take on as a beginner.
After digging through different source trees, I learned that this SoC is actually derived from another one that is already being actively upstreamed.
That was an important realization: instead of starting from scratch, I could build on existing work.

Every board still needs its own device tree so the kernel knows what hardware it can use.
Since one wasn’t available, I wrote one and sent out a patch, explaining that the SoC is likely identical or very similar to its parent design.
The patch was accepted, which gave me the opportunity to start testing and verifying functionality.

From there, I gradually learned how different kernel subsystems fit together, while also improving my tooling and workflow for embedded SoC development.
Tools like bootloaders, network boot setups, serial consoles, and tracing utilities became part of my everyday work.
Through this experimentation, I uncovered issues and missing pieces, which eventually led me to write patches of my own.

Upstreaming a new SoC has been especially engaging because it intersects with so many different parts of the kernel.
As a beginner, gradually learning about multiple subsystems this way has been both valuable and interesting.
I plan to stay involved with this effort and contribute more actively as development continues.

### Continuing the Journey

This mentorship showed me just how vast the Linux kernel world really is.
I’ve only scratched the surface, and there’s far more depth than I imagined.
I really enjoyed working with the kernel during this mentorship and I intend to continue to do so.

A big thank you to my mentors, fellow mentees, and especially Shuah Khan for guiding and supporting me along the way.

### Post notes

#### By the Numbers

To put the mentorship in perspective, I used Altuin to trace how many times I used key commands.
The counts aren’t perfectly accurate, I definitely missed some, but I found it fun to list:
- Kernel builds: 844
- Kernel config changes: 259
- Buildroot builds: 47
- Rootfs builds: 147
- Initramfs builds: 21
- TFTP file updates: 297
- UART sessions: 105

#### Using AI Wisely

Using AI tools feels almost inevitable right now, and I used them quite frequently throughout the program.
They became part of my workflow for unpacking unfamiliar concepts and doing quick "sanity checks" on code.
They’re great for fast explanations, summaries, and catching obvious mistakes. But they are not a source of truth.
These models can hallucinate or miss context, do not trust them blindly.
Before sending anything out, I build, run, and test thoroughly.
Skipping that step risks reflecting poorly on you and wasting maintainers’ time.
